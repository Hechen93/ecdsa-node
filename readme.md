## Week 1 Alchemy Bootcamp Project ECDSA Node

This project is my first draft version of the ECDSA client-server transfer balance project. This is my first real run at
anything using React hooks on the front end. This project was a real struggle for me to understand not just how the
signatures should be generated and validated by the client and server respectively, but also how project files should be
extracted, and how React components are updated via useState() and useEffect(). Shout out to the Alchemy community for
helping me work through the learning curve. In the future, I plan to revisit this project and update the UI so that I
can further my understanding on React.

In this project we see an example of a client attempting to view and transfer funds by communicating with a single
server. While this is a centralized example, the idea is that the transfer cannot occur without a proper private key
signature, which is related to the public address. By entering the correct sender address, the server is able to
validate the signature (by checking the signature sent by the client against the signature generated by the server) and
facilitate the balance transfer.

## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there
is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about
distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital
Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the
associated address.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow
these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these
steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on
any changes.
